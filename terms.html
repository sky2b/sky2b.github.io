                <h4>1. AddGears</h4>
                <p>
                    AddGears is an Application which is developed to provide useful and affordable
                    tools to the wide users community.
                    It can be used only in accordance with this End User agreement.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Development of the Application is sponsored through donations.</h4>
                <p>
                    The Application development and maintenance are sponsored by the End Users
                    through the donations and fees. Application is free for personal, non-commercial use ONLY.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Services.</h4>
                <p>
                    Users may request new application features and other services. By paying for such features and services End Users
                    sponsor further Application development. The source code and other resources produced as the result of such development are the property
                    of AddGears and could be used at our sole discretion. Users may not pass this source code to any third parties.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Reverse Engineering.</h4>
                <p>
                    You agree that You will not attempt to reverse compile, modify, translate, or disassemble the Application
                    in whole or in part except for the LGPL components included.
                </p>

                <h4>5. Limitation of Liability.</h4>
                <p>
                The Application is provided to the user “AS IS” with no warranties and AddGears
                disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to the user of any kind, whether expressed or implied.
                </p>

                <h4>6. Server Communication and updates.</h4>
                <p>
                When appropriate, the Application will contact the Server. It may verify the user status and check for available
                updates. When the new version of the Application becomes available, the Application upgrade could be conducted silently in the background.
                The user hereby authorizes these upgrades and transmissions. The Application does NOT send any personal or business information
                to the Server unless explicitly instructed to do so by the user for the purpose of data processing.
                </p>

                <h4>7. Compatibility.</h4>
                <p>
                AddGears does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with Your hardware or other software installed on Your computer system.
                Compatibility issues may cause Your computer’s performance to suffer.
                In the event that the Application is not compatible with Your hardware or other software installed on Your computer system, You should Uninstall the Application.
                Like all software, the Application utilizes some of Your computer’s resources to run, including system memory and Internet connection.
                Use of the Application on a computer with inadequate system resources will cause such computer’s performance to suffer.
                </p>

                <h4>8. Termination.</h4>
                <p>
                This agreement may be terminated by the user ceasing all use of the Application, destroying all copies. Please note that all donations, payments and fees are NOT
                refundable.
                </p>
