<h1>AddGears: a configurable way to combine existing technologies</h1>

<p>Today when on-line presence is the must for every business, there is a
demand for tools which could help develop web applications quickly and efficiently.
Too often you don&rsquo;t have time/budget for full scale application development and at the
same time need to find new creative ways to present your unique services and expertise
to all potential customers world wide.</p>

<p>Such high expectations look natural when you recall how quickly IT industry is currently evolving.
Indeed only two decades ago someone
had to have intimate knowledge of Visual C++ and Microsoft Visual Studio to develop
any useful application. Then
came HTML, PHP, MySQL, etc, and people found simpler, more declarative ways
to deliver useful functionality - web applications.</p>

<p>It looks like today technology landscape is also changing. We don&rsquo;t
need to put so much effort to generate static HTML markup anymore. Web standards are
quickly improving - you just need to modify CSS files to change your web page visual
appearance. Instead of purely static pages we easily create pretty complex web
applications consuming, when requested by user, data from numerous HTTP endpoints.
Mobile and desktop applications become as easy to develop as web sites (and often developed
using same HTML5 technologies). On the server side landscape is drastically changing
too. It looks like modern SQL databases became so mature, that can do practically
anything - from full
text search to parsing XML. And it takes only a few lines of code in modern programming
languages to create a simple HTML server.</p>

<p>With so many mature general
purpose tools and system libraries available (again think of SQL and NoSQL databases, web servers, messaging
middleware, etc) one must be able to create powerful applications, just creatively
combining existing well tested software products. And this is true, the only problem really is that combining
different technologies sometimes is a lot of work. Modern dynamic languages are much
easier to write then C++, but still, for complex application you need to write
a lot of code. The building blocks these languages provide are too elementary: this gives
you a lot of flexibility at the expense of increasing complexity. Often to much flexibility
which you don&rsquo;t really need.</p>

<p>AddGears on the other hand tries to reduce the complexity (at the expense of some flexibility)
and lower the barrier of expertise necessary to combine different technologies
to create applications. For this it provides building &ldquo;Lego&rdquo; blocks which everyone with
some technical knowledge would be able to reuse to quickly implement modern application.
In particular, we try to make it possible
to leverage just existing SQL skills to develop useful application. No need to learn new
technologies or hire new specialists, when you just need to query or persist some data
upon the user request. Today just a tech savvy guy with a basic
knowledge of SQL and web technologies may enjoy
developing functional web applications.</p>

<p>In practical terms AddGears seeks to solve common development problems
wrapping them in distinct, readily accessible and configurable units. To this end we introduce <em>components</em>
- configurable micro services performing
specific tasks. These components are configured through XML, to sequentially
perform elementary tasks. And they are able to pass data to each other through the shared
<em>namespace</em>.</p>

<p>To combine and manage components AddGears makefiles are used. There you can define <em>targets</em>
which could be invoked individually or jointly - to perform complex, compound actions.
To make the whole
system even more flexible, configuration files are treated as Go language
templates, so that they may contain parameters, may include other configuration files, etc.</p>

<p>AddGears comes with components wrapping common every day tasks: SQL, file operations,
HTTP server, user authentication. There are control statements components and even
components which execute scripts written in
built in scripting
language, which allows users to combine other components and there results
practically in any imaginable way.</p>

<p>All AddGears components and there attributes are documented. In addition AddGears comes with
examples and step by step tutorials. These (based on examples) tutorials show how using AddGears
someone may solve practical everyday problems: create HTTP API
endpoints, authenticate users, store and retrieve
data from MySQL tables, etc.</p>

<p>Vanilla AddGears application comes with only core, essential components. Our AddPricer
application builds on top of these core components, adding components for data-mining
and web scraping (making repricing a breeze).</p>

<p>Unlike many similar tools, AddGears is not bound to any server or cloud platform. You
can download and use it on premises, along with practically any technology stack.
Or we can install, support and develop AddGears based applications for you.</p>
