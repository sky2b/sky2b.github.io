<h1>Current state of IT technologies</h1>

<p>Today when on-line presence is the must for every business, there is a
demand for tools which could help develop web applications quickly and efficiently.
Too often business doesn&rsquo;t have time/budget for full scale application development and at the
same time needs to find new creative ways to present unique services and expertise
to all potential customers world wide.</p>

<p>Sounds contradictory? Then recall how quickly IT industry have been recently evolving.
Only two decades ago someone
had to have intimate knowledge of Visual C++ and Microsoft Visual Studio to develop
any useful application. Then
came HTML, PHP, MySQL, etc, and people found simpler, more declarative ways
to deliver useful functionality - web applications.</p>

<p>It looks like today technology landscape is also changing. We don&rsquo;t
need to put so much effort to generate static HTML markup anymore. Web standards are
quickly improving - you just need to modify CSS files to change your web page visual
appearance. Purely static pages give the way to pretty complex web
applications consuming data from various HTTP endpoints.
Mobile and desktop applications become as easy to develop as web sites (often developed
using same HTML5 technologies). On the server side landscape is drastically changing
too. For example modern SQL databases became so mature, that can do practically
anything - from full
text search to complex math in stored procedures. And it takes only a few lines of code in modern programming
languages to create a simple HTML server.</p>

<p>With so many mature general
purpose tools and system libraries available (SQL and NoSQL databases, web servers, messaging
middleware, etc) it must be possible to create powerful applications, just creatively
combining existing well tested software products. And while it is true, there is a catch:
combining different technologies sometimes is a lot of work too. Modern dynamic languages are much
easier to write then old C++, but for complex applications you  still need to write
a lot of code. The building blocks  provide programming languages are too elementary: this gives
you a lot of flexibility at the expense of increased complexity. Too much flexibility
which you don&rsquo;t really need.</p>

<h1>AddGears: a configurable way to combine existing technologies</h1>

<p>AddGears tries to reduce the complexity and lower the barrier of expertise necessary
to combine different technologies
when creating web applications. For this it provides building &ldquo;Lego&rdquo; blocks which everyone with
some technical knowledge would be able to reuse to quickly create web application.
First of all we try to make it possible
to just leverage your existing SQL skills to deliver useful functionality. No need to learn new
technologies or hire new specialists, when you just need to serve some data
upon user requests. Today any tech savvy guy with a basic
knowledge of SQL and web technologies may
develop functional web applications when backed by configurable database access:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!--
configure web server, serving &quot;static&quot; directory and API endpoint
returning list of books from database table
--&gt;
&lt;web-server address=&quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;&gt;
    &lt;directory path=&quot;/public/&quot; directory=&quot;static&quot; strip-prefix=&quot;/public/&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;endpoint path=&quot;/api/public&quot;&gt;
        &lt;http-handler action=&quot;data.type&quot;&gt;
            &lt;request form-value=&quot;data&quot; to=&quot;data&quot; type=&quot;json&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;response path=&quot;reply&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;action type=&quot;books&quot;&gt;
                &lt;db driver=&quot;mysql&quot; dataSource=&quot;root:root@/test&quot;/&gt;                
                &lt;select sql=&quot;select isbn, price from books&quot; to=&quot;reply.books&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;fields&gt;
                        &lt;field name=&quot;isbn&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;field name=&quot;price&quot; type=&quot;float&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/fields&gt;
                &lt;/select&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/http-handler&gt;
    &lt;/endpoint&gt;
&lt;/web-server&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>AddGears seeks to solve common development problems
wrapping functionality in distinct, configurable units or <em>components</em>. Components
are configured through XML, and, when executed sequentially,
 are able to pass data through the shared <em>namespace</em> (some attributes accept namespace
paths).</p>

<p>To combine and manage components AddGears uses YAML makefiles. There you can define <em>targets</em>
which could be invoked individually or jointly - to perform complex, compound actions.
To make the whole
system even more flexible, configuration files are treated as Go language
templates, so that they may contain parameters, may include other configuration files, etc.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">select:
    params:
        database: test
    run: select-books.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

save:
    params:
        file: books.csv
    run: save-csv.xml
    config: configuration/*.xml

export:
    - select
    - save
</code></pre>

<p>AddGears comes with components wrapping common every day tasks: SQL, file operations,
HTTP server, user authentication, control statements and even
components executing scripts written in built-in scripting
language (which closely follows Go language syntax). These all gives user power and flexibility
to combine components to solve real world problems.</p>

<h1>Where to go next</h1>

<p>All AddGears components and there attributes are <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/docs/api.html">documented</a>.
In addition AddGears comes with
examples and step by step <a href="http://docs.addgears.com/getting-started.html">tutorial</a>.
This tutorial shows how to solve practical everyday problems: create HTTP API
endpoints, authenticate users, store and retrieve
data from MySQL tables, etc.</p>

<p>Vanilla AddGears application comes with only core, essential components. Our <a href="http://pricer.addgears.com/">AddPricer</a>
application builds on top of these core components, adding components for data-mining
and web scraping (making repricing a breeze).</p>

<p>Unlike many similar tools, AddGears is not bound to any server or cloud platform. It
could be <a href="http://addgears.com/download.html">downloaded</a><br />
and used it on premises (see also <a href="installation.html">installation</a> instructions),
along with practically any technology stack.
Or we can <a href="http://addgears.com/pricing.html">install, support and develop</a> AddGears based applications for you.</p>
