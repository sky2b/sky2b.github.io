                <p>
                    <em>AddGears </em>is developed in the hope to deliver effective and affordable tools for business automation and data
                    processing. AddGears follows modern software trends and is developed as a set of tools called <a id="gear"></a><em>gears</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AddGears <em>gears</em> are designed to seamlessly cooperate with each other and third-party software.
                    The common application workflow is to import data from other application, process, analyse, and
                    export the results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the AddGears <em>gears</em> - <em>Harvester</em> enables users to easily extract missing data from anywhere
                    on the web. This process, known as web harvesting or web scraping, combined with data import and export
                    opens countless opportunities for data aggregation, competition analyses and similar applications.

                <h4>Intuitive tools</h4>
                <p>
                    AddGears application is designed as a set of tools or micro services. Each such tool
                    (called <a id="gear"></a><em>gear</em>)
                    excels in a very specific task. A typical <em>gear</em> includes both visual tools and supports scripting, which
                    makes them both easy to use and flexible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example, web scraping task is facilitated by two <em>gears</em>. One generates URLs (allowing to
                    test and visit web pages). Another <em>gear</em> is responsible for HTML parsing and allows visually
                    selecting different parts of HTML page and test live various CSS selectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harvester <em>gears</em> are controlled through the scripts - easy to write with simple API for HTML
                    parsing and math operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application comes with general purpose utilities like charts and grids which makes it easy to investigate
                    any data on every step of data processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AddGears is designed to work with big data sets, and allows easily transform them using math
                    operations and math operators. These and other tools make it ideal to use it as a re-pricer.

                <h4>Customisation and Enterprise grade services</h4>
                <p>
                    Although AddGears pays special attention to data import and export and provides scripting language and
                    continuously expending set of scripting APIs this is often not enough for users who are looking to
                    solve some very specific problem or strive to achieve seamless integration with existing software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily due its design and philosophy AddGears is very easy to extend and customise. It consist of relatively
                    independent, easy to reuse modules (or micro-services). It is developed using popular open source technologies
                    - HTML5 and node.js. If you have experience or some codebase implemented HTML5 and node.js it
                    could be seamlessly integrated in AddGears application as an extension. We also have experience of writing
                    extensions using C#, Java, Php, Go and Python and most likely will be able to integrate with any
                    application or technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although AddGears tools are pretty simple and intuitive, to use them effectively users need some technical
                    skills. For users who don't have enough skills, or need some missing functionality we propose
                    our software customisation services. For big Enterprise clients we recommend Enterprise package which includes
                    support and software customisation.
